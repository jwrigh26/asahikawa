        The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. If
        what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. If we're gonna walk
        though the woods, we need a little path. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only
        thing I have power over is the garbage. I really believe that if you practice enough you
        could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush.

        It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. And I will
        hypnotize that just a little bit. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use
        it. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Trees grow however makes them happy. We
        don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. At home you have
        unlimited time.

      <p>
        Here's something that's fun. It's important to me that you're happy. No pressure. Just relax
        and watch it happen. You have to make those little noises or it won't work.

        Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. I can't think of anything
        more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Let's build
        an almighty mountain.

        Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. All you need to paint is a few tools,
        a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Play with the angles.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Learn when to stop. We'll put a
        happy little bush here. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. Just go
        out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it.
